Feedback is provided for homework problems only if key items are omitted or if
errors are found. Below this list is another list of things that should be
fixed before full credit can be awarded.

When you have completed the fixes (which in most cases should take only a
minute or two), PLEASE E-MAIL daniel.hemberger@gmail.com to notify me
that you have pushed your changes.

Overall, everyone did a great job this week.  Thanks for your hard work!
