I) Format=bla;
bla is not a OneDimDataWriter.
Factory provides a list of known ClassIDs.

Each class that implements OneDimDataWriter has a member function
called ClassID which returns a string.  Factory is returning a list of
the ClassID()s from known OneDimDataWriters.  Of course, these are the
same strings that Factory uses to select the desired class.  ClassID
doesn't have to be the same as the class's name.

II) Format=help;
Factory provides a detailed description of each of the options.

Each class that implements OneDimDataWriter has a member function
called Help which returns a longer string, which is intended to
provide a description of what the class does, and what Options it may
take (although developers aren't perfect about maintaining the Help
text.)  This is what Factory is returning here.

III) Format=grace(Legennd=Yes);

OutputGrace's OptionParser gets passed "Legennd=Yes" and it complains
since Legennd isn't one of the Option strings being read.  First
OptionParser tells you that the Legennd Option was unread, then it
spits out the Help() text for OutputGrace.
