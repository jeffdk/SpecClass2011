I found the git / svn conversation helpful.  I thought Jeff's introduction could have been shorter.  I also enjoyed Curran's information, but unfortunately he didn't have much time to present it.  I like being able to type some of these comments in as class is happening.  
It was easy enough to ask questions and hear responses.

I'm not sure if this is too much work, but after completing each homework assignment, you could give light reading or try it yourself material as a lead-in to the next lecture.  This would make lectures more efficient.  It could be the last part of the previous homework set to read or try specific things out before next lecture.

I'm enjoying the class overall so far, and I appreciate the work put into it. Thanks
