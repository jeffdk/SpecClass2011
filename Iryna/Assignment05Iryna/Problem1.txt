### Problem 1 ###


(2) The second alternative is the slowest. It uses up extra memory by
    initializing the DataMesh to 0.0 before assigning a new value. 

(3) The third alternative is more efficient than the second alternative because
    it doesn't initialize DetF to some value when first creating it. 

(1) The first alternative is the fastest option. It sets the DataMesh to the 
    desired value at the time it's created.
