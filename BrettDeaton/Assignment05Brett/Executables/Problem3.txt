Problem 3

1) Simple case
After running my executable at t=2.0, at two settings of MinAngle, default (0.), and
      0.01, I ran:
$ expr (wc -l problem3_default.dat) - (wc -l problem3.dat)
???
So at a MinAngle=0.01, my data is reduced by ??? points.

2) Robustness
This reduction method is certainly not robust the way I programmed it. It would fail
     for any function whose slope continuously changes by less than MinAngle per dx.
     Thus our method would faile for any arbitrary well-behaved function if we choose dx small
     enough. That is we can always choose dx small enough such that we reduceddat only outputs
     the first and last points.
An improvement would be to compare global slopes rather than local. This could be done
     by setting an 'anchor segment' at the line segment just before the last one dropped.
     All subsequent angles of line segments would be evaluated with respect to the anchor segment.
