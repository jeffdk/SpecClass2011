Problem 3
=========
Header file lacks #define guards!

RecomputeData() assumes 3 dimensions but doesn't check for it.

TDm res is not needed - should assign the components of mResult directly (see reference solution for an AMR-compatible initialization).

Help() text and implementation are inconsistent: Help() says it returns the gradient of \hat{r}^i/r^3 (which would be a rank-2 tensor), while the implementation returns r^i/r^3.
