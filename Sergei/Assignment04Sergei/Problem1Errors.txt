There were several problems with the code:

1) Pi was declared a int - it is not! Need to change it to const double

2) r was declared twice, declare it only once

3) In result += (4/3)*Pi*r*r*r, 4/3 is an integer division which will 
always result in a value of 0. Change it to 4./3

4) In the for loop,
for(i=0;i<radii.Size();++i),

it should be i++ not ++i to get the correct counting

5) For better readability, int i should be declared as part of the for loop:

for(int i=0;i<radii.Size();i++)

so we know it serves simply as a counter
