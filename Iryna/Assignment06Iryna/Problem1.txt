- The code doesn't seem to be using NonCopyable, which  makes it an extra 
  dependency (which is inefficient). 
- The error message could be more clear ("OOPS" is pretty vague)
- VolumeTerm and VolumeTermImpl use forward declarations while RotationMatrix 
  doesn't. Also, RotationMatrix has much fewer comments. 
- The RotationMatrix default constructor is completely empty.
- The member function RotationMatrix::Impl() should probably be made private.
