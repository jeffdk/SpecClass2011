What happens with Problem2Exec when:

1. Format=bla;
	You get an error that says that ClassID 'bla' was not found
	and lists the known ClassIDs.

2. Format=help;
	You get an error message that gives you all the known ClassIDs
	and their descriptions.

3. Format=grace(Legennd=Yes);
	You get an error message that says that the "legennd" option is wrong
	and then gives you the description for the grace ClassID.

Where do output strings come from?

1. This comes from the string ClassID() within each OneDimDataWriter class.

2. This is each Help() string from each OneDimDataWriter class.

3. This is the Help() string from the grace ClassID.
