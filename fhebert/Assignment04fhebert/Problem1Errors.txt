well, where to begin?

errors:

line  3   : Pi is a double, not an int!

lines 7+  : the for loop lacks {}'s around its body!! only line 8 is actually
            going to be looped over. thus in line 9, r is the r declared outside
            of the for loop, which is uninitialized, giving undefined behavior!
            this bug could be prevented by only declaring r inside the loop!

line  9   : (4/3) is integer division and has value 1, not 1.333



not necessarily wrong, but in poor form:

line  5   : we could declare i in the for loop parens. this would clean up
            the code, and reduce i's scope, catching potential errors

lines 6/8 : the two declarations of r are redundant. either keep it within
            the loop, declaring it at each step so as to reduce its lifetime
            and catching bugs such as discussed above (preferred),
            or declare it outside only (possibly reducing runtime overhead?)

line  9   : r^3 is more elegantly obtained from pow(r,3) than r*r*r

also, the inclusion of MyVector.hpp in the the header file is not necessary,
as we're not defining anything. we could use a class definition of MyVector,
and place the #include"MyVector.hpp" in the .cpp file instead.
