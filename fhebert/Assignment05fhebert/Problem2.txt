i.
Format = bla;

get an error:
[0] ##########################   ERROR   ###########################
Factory<16OneDimDataWriter>
ClassID 'bla' not found. Known ClassIDs:
dat      dump     grace    oned     pmetric  ygraph   
################################################################

this error comes from the Factory class after it looked for and was
unable to find a derived OneDimDataWriter class that registered as "bla"



ii.
Format = help;

for each OneDimDataWriter that is registered with the Factory,
prints its ClassID and the corresponding documentation.
the documentation string comes from calling the Help() function
that each derived OneDimDataWriter implements.



iii.
Format = grace(Legennd=Yes);

prints two messages:
a message from the OptionParser notifying of an unused options (Legennd)
and the Help() string from the specific derived class, here OutputGrace
