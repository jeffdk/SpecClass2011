Problem 1
=========
Assuming that A is a TDm, Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it actually calls DataMesh's copy constructor.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).

Problem 3
=========
Undefined behavior if x.Size()==0!  Incorrect behavior if x.Size()==1.

Base class guarantees that x.Size()==y.Size(), so you need only mention this assumption in a comment (though in my opinion, REQUIREing it again is fine).

Output from different times is not written to separate files.
