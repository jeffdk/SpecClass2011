I. Format = bla:  This is not a known ClassID.  Any time you would like to know
  the full list of class IDs, you can insert garbage and obtain the list.

II. Format = help:  This option will list all of the different ClassIDs along
  with any help strings associated with them.

III. Format = grace(Legennd=Yes): The option parser correctly finds grace; 
  however, it cannot find the option Legennd.  This will also reproduce the
  help text, which should in theory tell you the options that should be provided

I was expecting the output string to be taken from the ClassID, but for some
reason it's not.  The output comes from something called mFileName, in the
case of the grace output for example.  Here it's just BaseName + ".grace".  I
was expecting BaseName + "." + ClassID().  It seems redundant otherwise.
