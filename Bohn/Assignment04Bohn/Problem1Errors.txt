1.No if guards for the hpp file
2.MyVector doesn't need to be included.  See my hpp for correct implementation
3.Pi should be a const double
4.A bit nitpicky, but int i and double r don't need to be in scope for the 
  entire file.  This can be avoided with curly braces
5.r is declared twice. The first declaration is completely unused, since
  it is shadowed by the double r in the for loop.
6.int i and r should probably be initialized
7.(4/3) is an integer division, and would probably return 1, which is then 
  converted to a double for the multiplication of doubles
