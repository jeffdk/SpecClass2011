In increasing order of memory accesses, the alternatives are (1), (3), and (2).

(3) calls a copy constructor on A(0,0), which requires a call to check the extents and size to allocate memory for DetF, and it requries another call to check the size in order to initialize the size counter.

(2) does the same as (3), but also runs through the DataMesh, initializing all the values to 0.0 .
