hw 6 - prob 3


1)
changed output of FirstDeriv to "dQflattened"

=> "!KeyExists violated" error

code is saying i'm trying to add an already-existing item
to the data box. this is because FlattenDeriv's output is
*also* dQflattened.



2)
changed input of FirstDeriv to "dQflattened"

=> "!RecomputeMyself violated" error

this is because i've added a cyclical dependency:
- FirstDeriv needs dQflattened to output dQ
- FlattenDeriv needs dQ to output dQflattened



3) -just for kicks, this is kinda fun-
added a deliberate typo in an input "FirstDeriv(Input=QQ;"

=> a long list of known variables
=> "Key 'QQ' not in DataBox..." error

unsurprisingly, the code doesn't know how to handle an
undefined variable as its input.
