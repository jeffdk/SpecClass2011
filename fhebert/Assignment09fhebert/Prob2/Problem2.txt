hw 9 - prob 2

i wrote two new domain input files: use with the -domaininput
option on ApplyObservers.

i find:

1)
filling the hole with a sphere gives the correct volume of 8 (2^3)

2)
filling the hole with a cube gives the incorrect volume of 8.91..
this is due to the integrator proceding on each subdomain independently
without checking whether the regions overlap.

i'm not sure how to solve this..
