By choosing a cutoff angle of just 0.5 degrees, the total number of output points was reduced from 2049 to just 77.

This method does not sound robust to me.  One could imagine that a plot could change very slowly, such that \alpha is very nearly zero, but over long distances it can make quite a difference.  A suggestion for changing this algorithm is to check the i-th component against the last printed component, not just the i-1 component.
