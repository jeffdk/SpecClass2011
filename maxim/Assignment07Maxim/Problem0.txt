// Problem0Example0.cpp
void f(double x) {
   x = 3;
}
int main() {
  double x = 6;
  f(x);
  std::cout << x << std::endl; // prints 6
}


//------------------------------------------------


// Problem0Example1.cpp
void f(double& x) {
   x = 3;
}
int main() {
  double x = 6;
  f(x);
  std::cout << x << std::endl; // prints 3
}

Explanation:
In C++ by default parameters of the function are passed by value. In the first example x is passed by its value and a new variable x is created inside of the function f. After the function finishes local x is distroyed not affecting x declared in main().

In the second example the variable is passed by reference. No copy of x is created insdie f instead the variable from main is used and thus it gets changed after the function finishes.
