When compiling library for the first time: 

Compiler warnings:
  * conversion to 'int' alters 'double' constant value
	- the function declares "Pi" as an int, when it is in fact a double
  * declaration of 'r' shadows a previous local
  * unused variable 'r' 
  * 'r' is used uninitialized in this function 
	- 'r' is unnecessary in the code (see correction)
  

Other mistakes: 
  * we can initialize int i inside the for loop
  * change 4/3 to 4.0/3.0 to keep correct value (4/3 = 1)
  * variable 'result' could be more clearly named -> 'totalVolume'


More mistakes (adding corrections to assignment 4): 

  * don't need to include MyVector.hpp in the header 
  * need to have include guards in the header
