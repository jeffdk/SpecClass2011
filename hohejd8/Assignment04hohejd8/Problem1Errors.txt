In Volume_NAME.hpp:
  -There are no comments about the function and usage of this routine.

In Volume_NAME.cpp:
  -Again, no comments about the routine, the variables, or anything else.
  -The variable 'const int Pi' should be a 'const double Pi'.
  -The variables 'result' and 'i' are declared early; they should be declared closer to their actual use in the program.
  -The variable 'r' is mirrored, and is largely unnecessary, as it is just a copy of the value already contained in 'radii[i]'.
  -The for-loop is only executed on the line 'double r = radii[i]', and does not include the useful 'result +=' statement.
  -The fraction '(4/3)' when used as a double should be written '(4.0/3.0)'.
