# Vectors.input
# Defines vectors to be added by ./TestSumVectorsCurran.
#
# OPTIONS:
#   FirstVectorToAdd  = double, double, ...;  # First addend
#   SecondVectorToAdd = double, double, ...;  # Second addend
#   Divisor           = double;               # Divisor (!=0)
#
# For the test to pass, these two vectors should be minus one another.
 
FirstVectorToAdd  =  3.1,  4.1,  5.9;
SecondVectorToAdd = -3.1, -4.1, -5.9;
Divisor           = 2.6;

# Any of the following changes will cause the test to fail:
#SecondVectorToAdd = -3.0, -4.1, -5.9;
#Divisor           = 0.0;
