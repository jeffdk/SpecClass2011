Problem 1: Errors with original version of TotalVolumeOfSpheresFromRadii
  Brett Deaton
  7.19.11

L3	3.14* is not an int
L5	needless declaration of i outside of for loop scope; wastes memory
*L6	dangerously uninitialized double r
*L7-9	should be bracketed {...}
*L8	newly defined r is ambiguous to the humans, but g++ knows it dies outside the loop
L9	casting of 4/3 may result in an int?

The overall effect of the starred errors is that result is calculated with an uninitialized r, on my
    compiler that means it's 0.
