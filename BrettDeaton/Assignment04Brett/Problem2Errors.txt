Problem 2: Errors with original version of RaiseToPower
  Brett Deaton
  7.25.11

Line 4 of RaiseToPower_Brett.cpp evaluates an expression which assigns
the value of zero to n. Here's how the computer sees it happen:

if(n=0) return 1;

1) evaluate n=0
      n=0 assigns the value 0 to variable n, and returns false because the
      value of n is 0 (false).
2) evaluate if(~)
      ~ is false since n is not nonzero, so the then statement at line 4 is
      not evaluated.
3) evaluate n>1
      This time false because the logical statement is false, so the then
      statement at line 5 is not evaluated.
4) return a
      The only thing left to do is line 6.

Of course the bug is fixed by changing line 4 to:
if(n==0) return 1;
