"if (n = 0)" doesn't have the desired effect.  n == 0 is what we want.

  What happens in this code is n = 0 assigns n to zero, which causes the
  if to fail.  Then the code fails n > 1, since it's 0.  The code then falls
  through to the last return, return 2 in this case. 

By making n a const, this code will cause a compile error, if trying to assign
to n
