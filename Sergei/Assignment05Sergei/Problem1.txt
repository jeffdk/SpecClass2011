The different methods of initialize DetF are ranked from the fewest number
of memory accesses to the most by:

1)
3)
2)

This is because 1) employs the copy constructor which automatically allocates
the memory for the new DataMesh object and then initializes all the member
variables to the values on the right hand side of the = operator.

3) is more efficient than 2) because 2) not only allocates memory for a new object like 3) but it also goes through element by element and initializes it to 0 first and only then computes the determinant. Meanwhile 3) simply allocates the memory and then uses the assignment operator to initialize DetF.
