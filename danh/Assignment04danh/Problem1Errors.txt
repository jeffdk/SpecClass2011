1. Pi was declared as an int instead of a double
2. result was declared too early
3. int i was declared in the global scope instead of the local scope of the for loop
4. double r was declared twice (only inside the loop was necessary)
5. double r did not need to be declared at all (radii[i] could be used instead)
6. braces were missing around the for loop
7. MyVector is included instead of being declared in the .hpp file
