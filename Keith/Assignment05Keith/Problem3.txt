At time = 0.5 with an angle cutoff of 0.01 degrees the plots look
indistinguishable.

So the number of entries is reduced by about a factor of 6.

================

Not robust.

Consider a circle represented by equally spaced x,y values.  In this
case the angle is the same at every point and with our current
differential angles algorithm, either all points will be dropped, or
none.  

Possible improvement:

Let's consider our current differential angles measure as just one of
a class of similar metrics estimating the local curvature of the data.

***The algorithm could be improved by making it iterative.***
Decompose the full data set into non-overlapping minimal subsets on
which the metric of choice can be evaluated.  Drop all points for
which the metric threshold is satisfied.  Repeat the process on this
new data set.

The non-overlapping restriction is actually overly strong, e.g. for
our differential angles metric we merely want to make sure that
adjacent points are not dropped in the same iteration.

Noisy data:

Noisy data is more of a problem.  For purely random data the removal
of any given point does not alter the content of the data, it might be
visually distinguishable, but there is no loss of content.  

Now, what about the case where the data is simply noisy, i.e. random
data superimposed on a smooth curve.  In this case a spectral
filtering method would be more effective.
