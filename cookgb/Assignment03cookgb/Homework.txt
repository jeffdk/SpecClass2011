MyClass2-

-> a2 = a1; // fails
a2 is declaired as const, so its value cannot be changed after it is created.

-> b3 = 5; // fails
the private member variable of MyClass2B is const, so it cannot be changed after the class is created

-> b3 = b2; // fails
the private member variable of MyClass2B is const, so it cannot be changed after the class is created

-> c3 = 5; // fails
because the constructor is declared as explicit, an implicit cast will not be allowed even thought the integer(as only argument) constructor is present.
