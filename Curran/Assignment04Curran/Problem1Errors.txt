 1) The header file lacks include guards.
 2) The header file includes "MyVector.hpp" when a forward declaration would suffice.
 3) The variable "Pi" is declared as an int instead of a double.
 4) The scope of the loop iterator "i" is too large; it should be declared by the "for" loop.  The declaration outside the loop does not give it an initial value.
 5) The variable "r" outside the loop is declared without an initial value.
 6) The variable "r" is shadowed inside the loop.
 7) The variable "r" inside the loop could be made "const".
 8) The coefficient (4/3) performs integer division and will evaluate to 1.
 9) The "for" loop lacks braces, but indentation indicates it contains two statements.  The net effect is that "result" will be incremented by a random number (which depends on the uninitialized value of the now-unshadowed variable "r").
10) The name "result" isn't very descriptive (though assuming you know what function you're in, its meaning should be clear).  A better name might be "accumulated_volume".
11) There are no Doxygen comments in the header file.
12) There are no comments in the implementation (yes, it's pretty self-explanatory, but the student still managed to mess it up).
