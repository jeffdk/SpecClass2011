Problem 3
=========
I would get the Mesh by asking for "Mesh" from the DataBox rather than by slicing a DataMesh.

Initializing 'tmp' to 'radius' is wasteful; initialize to 'mesh' instead (see Assignment 5, Problem 1).

The variable 'tmp' is not needed - just use mResult directly (see reference solution for an example of AMR-compatible initialization).

Help() text and implementation are inconsistent: Help() text says you are computing \hat{r}^i/r^3, but the implementation returns r^i/r^3.
