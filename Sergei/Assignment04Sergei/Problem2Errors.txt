The bug comes from the following line:
if(n=0) return 1;

The operation in the paranthesis is not actually a truth comparison as
was logically intended but rather an assignment operator. To fix this error,
use if(n==0) instead. In order to catch the error at compile time,
change the signature of the function to
unsigned int RaiseToPower(unsigned int a,  const unsigned int n) 
Now this will not compile with the error, because one cannot assign to
a const.
