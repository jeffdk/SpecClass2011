Random Issues and Possible Solutions

* If having a hard time compiling/making execs (weird error messages?) 
    - try make -s allclean

* In gccdebug, if terminal complains that it can't find the command 
  'ApplyObservers', try exporting the PATH to include Support/bin
    - export PATH=/SPEC_HOME/Support/bin:$PATH

* Remember!: To copy  EvolveGrHydro link to SpEC if you're starting a new run
  and have recently updated the SpEC code. 

* In debug run, couldn't find class because the ComputeItem (.cpp) file 
  containing it wasn't included in the MakeFile in Hydro/HydroComputeItems

* In debug run, error message: "status == 0 violated in Rtsafe.cpp" -
  something wrong with ComputeItem

* When running ApplyObservers - if compiler gives warining that Class wasn't
  in the known list of Class IDs, maybe you need to add a library to the 
  Makefile in Support/ApplyObservers/Executables (in ALL_LINKED_LIBS, not 
  necessarily in LINKED_LIBS too)
