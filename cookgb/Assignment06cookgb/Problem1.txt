In RotationMatrix.cpp and .hpp, you could switch to the Factory
approach rather than using the Registry.

You could use better error messages in the ASSERTs.

In class RotationMatrix::operator= you could do a check on "ptr"
before deleting it.  This should be set to zero since it is first
created by the default constructor which sets mpImpl to zero.  So,
deleting this pointer should do nothing (and shouldn't be necessary).
But, if it isn't zero, then something is wrong and the pointer
probably shouldn't be deleted.
