I have one serious objection: Jeff said there were "good questions" and 
"bad questions." This is absolutely false; there is no such thing as 
a bad question!

Even worse, when somenoe asked a question, at one point 
Jeff said, "Sorry, that's a bad question" and refused to answer it. 
I found this action puzzling and a little offensive.

Students should always feel free and unfraid to ask anything, no matter 
how it might sound.

When I teach lecture 2, I will explicitly correct the record on this: 
there is no such thing as a bad question. We might need to defer 
some questions' answers to the mailing list or a private discussion because 
of time constraints, but that's all.
