Overall, everyone did a great job this week.  Thanks for your hard work!

Bohn/

1)  Lacks documentation. 
    Test does not actually test that the correct volume is returned.
    Insufficient includes in the test .cpp file to compile.
3)  Did not delete pMemLeaker in UseMemoryLeaker.cpp

TODO:
1. Make sure the test in problem 1 actually tests that the volume returned
   by the library is correct.
2. Make sure all new's have a delete in problem 3.
