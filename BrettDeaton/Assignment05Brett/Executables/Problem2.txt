Problem 2

I.   Format = bla
	Factory does not recognize bla as a type of OneDimDataWriter, so it give me an error
	message with a list of recognized options. I think these come from the registry,
	RegisteredClassIDs(), which uses the strings returned by the respective member functions
	ClassID().

II.  Format = help;
	The help tag forces the Registry to give me a list of possible OneDimDataWriters, and
	it also appears to call the member Help() functions.

III. Format = grace(Legennd=Yes;)
	OptionParser prints a list of unused options, from member TerminateIfThereAreUnusedOptions().
	It also calls the Help() member of the OneDimDataWriter being used.
