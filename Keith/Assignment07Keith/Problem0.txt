Example0) Pass by value means that a local copy is made of the
variable passed in the argument.  That copy is the one that is
subsequently modified in the body of the function.  Thus, on return,
the original variable is unchanged, and in this case the output is 6,
as set in main().


Example1) Pass by reference means that the original variable passed in
the argument is the one modified in the body of the function.  Thus,
on return, the original variable *is* modified, and in this case the
output is 3, as set in f().
