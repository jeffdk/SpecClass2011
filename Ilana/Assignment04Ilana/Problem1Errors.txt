Problems with Volume_Ilana

The function does not return the correct value because:

- Pi is a double, not an int, so even if it has decimal places, only the 3 
will be registered.

- There should be brackets around the two lines following the for loop.

- 3 and 4 are considered integers.  They should be written 3.0 and 4.0.

Stylistic errors:

- Better to use built-in constants instead of typing them out because you 
could make typographic errors.  Therefore, I'm using M_PI.

- MyVector.hpp should be included in .cpp file and not .hpp file.

- He didn't put any comments in the .hpp file.

- Variables can be declared and initialized at the same time, such as i and r.

- r can be declared const

- r can be declared only within the for loop so as not to waste memory for 
the entire duration of the function.
