1. Include directives

Includes should be used in a manner that maximizes efficiency, not convenience.
Therefore, several includes are unnecessary:

MyVector.hpp
NonCopyable.hpp
Assert.hpp

It may not be obvious that Assert.hpp is unnecessary, but it is if we move the
implementation of several functions into RotationMatrix.cpp.

2. Default constructor

3. The member-function RotationMatrix::Impl()
