When MinAngle = 0.0, there are 2043 points at t=1.0.
When MinAngle = 0.4, there are 231 points at t=1.0.

This method is not completely robust.  It can fail if the spacing
between points is large compared to the scale of the graph.  In this
case, even if the angle is small, a perceptible change in the plot
will occur.  A robust algorithm would need to know the extents of the
plot and consider fractional changes compared to the total extents.
