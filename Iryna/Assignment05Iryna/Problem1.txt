(3) The third alternative is slowest because it uses DataMesh's copy 
    constructor. 

(2) The second alternative is more efficient because sets each element to 0.0
    by writing it instead of copying it. 

(1) The first alternative is the fastest option. It sets the DataMesh to the 
    desired value at the time it's created.
