Problem 2 - Returning References

The problem with this function is the ampersand in double& add(...). The
ampersand means that it will return a reference to the local variable c, and
this is problematic because c only exists within the function itself.  That is,
c will no longer be allocated at the end of the function, and so returning a
reference to it won't give you anything.
