fewest to most memory-accesses;
1, 3, 2

Both 2 and 3 call a DataMesh(const Mesh&, ...)  constructor to create
DetF requiring a memory-access.  In both cases the mesh is obtained
from A requiring a memory-access.  Then they call the assignment
operator which requires another memory-access.

2 requires an additional memory-access to zero out the memory
allocated to DetF.  This is unnecessary since the next step is to
assign DetF.

1 simply calls the copy constructor.  So only one memory-access for
assignment.

All use the "Construct from expression" constructor for DetF to
evaluate the rhs, which is several memory accesses, but they're all
the same in that respect.
