Problem 1
=========
Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it actually calls DataMesh's copy constructor.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).

Problem 2
=========
Comment out parameter name "time" to avoid compiler warnings.

Use a .gitignore file to ignore "Executables/Problem2Exec".

Problem 3
=========
Undefined behavior if x.Size()==0!  Incorrect behavior if x.Size()==1.

Write classes in .hpp/.cpp pairs, even if they are implementations of base classes that will never be directly instantiated.

Output files should have a common extension (like ".dat").

Should document the assumption that x.Size()==y.Size() (this is ensured by the base class, but you should probably mention that fact in a comment).

Your results differ from those of the reference implementation (they actually look "better", but I'm not sure they're correct for the assigned algorithm).
