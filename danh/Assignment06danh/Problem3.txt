1. Breaking the input files

a) First, I tried removing one of the DataBoxItems.  I commented out the 
"GlobalDifferentiator" item.

What this error means is that the Observer has a "Get" call for the output
of GlobalDifferentiator. But since I didn't put it in the DataBox, the Observer
dies because it can't find it.

b) Second, I tried to put everything into the Domain databox instead of the
Subdomain databox.  I got the following error:

This is basically the same error as a) because the Observer could not find
the items in the Subdomain databox. Even though divQ is in the Domain databox,
the Observer doesn't have access to it.
