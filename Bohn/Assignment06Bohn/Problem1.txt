  In the hpp file, there are two headers which aren't used.  The code compiles
and runs without the headers MyVector and NonCopyable.  
These should be removed.
  If I received the assert message "Oops", I would have no idea what was
happening and would go bug Larry, or even worse from the grader's perspective,
Curran.  I don't think Larry or Curran would want me bugging them over a 
non-descriptive assert message.
  In contrast to VolumeTerm and VolumeTermImpl, RotationMatrix is not utilizing
forward declarations.  There is no RotationMatrixImpl.hpp, so a lot of the
benefits for the pimpl setup are lost.  Additionally, if there were a
RotationMatrixImpl.hpp, less header files would need to be included in 
RotationMatrix.hpp, again reducing dependencies.
  The default constructor seems to be around line 63.  I would argue that
this constructor should be removed.  I don't see a use for this where other 
constructors couldn't do a better job.  This will return a null pointer, which 
is dangerous if anyone tries to use the RotationMatrix in any way.  Although
an assert would be raised if you were in debug mode.
  
  Summary:
  remove unnecessary header files
  more descriptive assert message
  implement a RotationMatrixImpl
  utilize forward declarations
  remove default constructor
