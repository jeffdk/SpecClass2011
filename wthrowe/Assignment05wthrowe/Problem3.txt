At time 0, using MinAngle=0.002 only 369 points were output, omitting
1680.

This algorithm has trouble with curves with very slowly varying
direction, because it will not notice large changes in direction
constructed from many small changes.  It would be better to check that
the lines between (last, last+1) and (last, i+1) were close in angle,
where last is the index of the last output point.
