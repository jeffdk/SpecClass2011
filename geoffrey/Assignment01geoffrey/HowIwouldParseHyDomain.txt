To parse HyDomain.input, I would use OptionParsers with SplitParentheses and 
RemoveOverAllParenthesesIfPresent. 

OptionParsers would read in 

  SubdomainStructure = ...

  BaseName = ...

  x-Axis = ...
  y-Axis = ...
  z-Axis = ...

SplitParentheses would split up PerimBlocks and its arguments.

RemoveOverAllParentheseIfPresent would remove the parentheses from 
the values read in for the axes.
