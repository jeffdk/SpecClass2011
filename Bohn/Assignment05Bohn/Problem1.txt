From slowest to fastest:

(3) : This is the slowest method by a small bit. 
      At the time the memory is allocated, the DataMesh copies the data from A
      and stores it.  Then the variable is set to the correct value.

(2) : This method is the second slowest.  
      At the time the memory is allocated, the DataMesh initializes all values
      to 0.0, which takes less time than reading A and copying the data.
      Then the variable is set to the correct value.

(1) : This method is the fastest.  At the time that the memory is allocated, 
      the memory is initialized to the desired value.
      Compared to (3), we do not have to access the memory DetF again.  The 
      value of DetF is immediately initialized the first time it is accessed, 
      that is, when it is allocated.
