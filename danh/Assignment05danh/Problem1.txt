Question for Curran:
Should "A" be replaced with "F"?  Otherwise we don't know if "A" is a Mesh or
a DataMesh, right?  It might not change the answer, but the constructors
are different depending on what "A" is...

Ranking of procedures in order of speed (fastest first):
#1. (1)
#2. (3)
#3. (2)

Reasons why alternatives to 1. are inferior:
- Whenever you can compute something on the same line it is declared, do it!
- Both #2 and #3 are inferior because they must access the mesh of "A" to set
  the Mesh of DetF in addition to doing the operator= accesses.
- #2 is faster than #3 because in addition to setting the mesh, it has to
  initialize the values of DetF on the Mesh, which requires more accesses.

NOTE: althought #2 is faster than #3, it is probably less safe (another reason
why #1 is thoroughly ideal) because it leaves DetF uninitialized prior to its
computation. Here it's not so big a deal, but in more complicated code, it
could be dangerous.
