Problem 1
=========
Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it calls DataMesh's copy constructor, which not only checks the extents for compatibility, but also copies all of the data.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).
