The code outputs: {4 "12"}
It allocated a total of 17,341,210 bytes.
After changing the function parameters to references, it allocates
  10,427,290 bytes.
The ratio of the original memory usage to the later usage is 1.66.
This is because we eliminate 2 of the 5 TDms that are created when we change
  to references.  The TDms are (abusing notation a bit):
  1. add()::a - changed to a reference to main()::a.
  2. add()::b - changed to a reference to main()::b.
  3. main()::a
  4. main()::b
  5. main()::c, add()::result, and an unnamed temporary object, which are all
     actually the same object because of return value optimization.
