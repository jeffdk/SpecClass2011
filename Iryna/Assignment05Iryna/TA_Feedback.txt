Problem 1
=========
Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it actually calls DataMesh's copy constructor.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).

Problem 2
=========
What "help text" is shown in case 1? (it doesn't show any; instead, it lists all known ClassIDs for OneDimDataWriters).

In case 3, do you get anything other than the message that option Legennd was not used? (you should get the Help() text for the 'grace' OneDimDataWriter, which lists the valid options).

Try to keep lines from exceeding 80 characters.

Could not compile executable; see Problem 3.

Problem 3
=========
OutputReducedDatIryna does not compile; problems with OutputReducedDatIryna.hpp (you need to use "std::string", not just "string").

No Problem3.txt

Why are you copying the filename to a stringstream just to pass it to an fstream?

Outputs from different times are not written to separate files.

Base class guarantees that x.Size()==y.Size(), so you need only mention this assumption in a comment (though in my opinion, REQUIREing it again is fine).

Is it really the end of the world if size_x==0?
