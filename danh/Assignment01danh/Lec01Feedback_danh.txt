The lectures were fantastic.  I especially liked that there was an emphasis on making sure there was a time to answer questions.  However, since that time was taken, I think some of the more basic components of lecture 01 (e.g. course materials, course structure, etc.) could have been left a little more open-ended -- they didn't require the exhaustive coverage that was given to them.
