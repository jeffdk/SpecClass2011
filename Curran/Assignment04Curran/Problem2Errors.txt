Checking for equality requires the "==" operator; the "=" operator performs assignment.  In this code, "n" is set to zero, then "a" is returned unmodified.

This bug could be caught at compile time by declaring "n" to be const in the cpp file.  The compiler will issue an error like:
RaiseToPower_Curran.cpp: In function ‘unsigned int RaiseToPower(unsigned int, unsigned int)’:
RaiseToPower_Curran.cpp:4:8: error: assignment of read-only parameter ‘n’

Fortunately, modern compilers issue a warning for this mistake:
RaiseToPower_Curran.cpp: In function ‘unsigned int RaiseToPower(unsigned int, unsigned int)’:
RaiseToPower_Curran.cpp:4:9: warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value
