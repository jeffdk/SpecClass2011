Problem 2
=========
Use a .gitignore file to ignore "Executables/Problem2Exec".

Problem 3
=========
Undefined behavior if xlen=0!

Should document the assumption that x.Size()==y.Size() (this is ensured by the base class, but you should probably mention that fact in a comment).

Write classes in .hpp/.cpp pairs, even if they are implementations of base classes that will never be directly instantiated.

Avoid lines longer than 80 characters, even in Help() texts.
