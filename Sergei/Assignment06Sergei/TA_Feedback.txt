Problem 3
=========
You can get "Mesh" from the DataBox instead of constructing your own.

Initializing 'answer' to 0.0 is wasteful (see Assignment 5, Problem 1).

Assumes three dimensions but does not check for it.

The DataMesh 'answer' is not needed - can assign to mResult directly (see reference solution for an AMR-compatible example).

Help() text and implementation are inconsistent: Help() text says you return r^i/r, but implementation returns r^i/r^3.
