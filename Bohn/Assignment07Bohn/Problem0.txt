---Problem0Example0.cpp
-x is declared and initialized to 6
-f(x) passes 6 to the function, assigns the variable x to 3 only in the scope
  of the function, returns nothing since it's void
-6 is printed, since the variable x in the scope of main was unchanged

---Problem0Example1.cpp
-x is declared and initialized to 6
-f accepts a reference to a double, so x is casted to a reference to a double
  and passed by reference.  x is changed by reference to 3 in the function, 
  which still returns nothing
-3 is printed, since it was changed in the function by a reference
