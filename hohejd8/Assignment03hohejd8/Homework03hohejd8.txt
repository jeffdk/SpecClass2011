For the homework questions about classes:

l.31 The compiler won't let me change the value of a2 because it is declared as a const instance of the MyClass2A class.

l.36 The compiler won't let me change the value of b3 because the private variable cc inside MyClass2B is a const.

l.37 Same as above; MyClass2B::cc is a const member and cannot be changed after initialization.

l.39 Since the constructor for MyClass2C is explicit, it cannot be instantiated by an implicit conversion from type int to type MyClass2C.

l.43 The compiler won't let me change the value of c3 because operator= is not defined for this class, and because MyClass2C is explicit, an implicit conversion is not allowed.
