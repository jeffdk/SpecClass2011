Problem 1
=========
Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it actually calls DataMesh's copy constructor.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).

Problem 2
=========
Comment out parameter name "time" to avoid compiler warnings.

Use a .gitignore file to ignore "Executables/Problem2Exec".
