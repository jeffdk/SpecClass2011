I though the first lecture was very good.  I already knew most of the stuff
about how to check out and compile the code, but I had never heard of
git before.  I'm not sure I understood everything on the first go, but doing 
the assignment certainly helped solidify it all.  I would say that the format 
is good, but it was hard to see the remote desktop at times.  I don't know how 
this could be improved.  I think as long as we have all the examples on the 
wiki, this should be fine.
