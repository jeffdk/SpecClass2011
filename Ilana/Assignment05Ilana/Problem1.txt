Order of alternatives allocations of DetF with increasing number of memory-accesses:

(1) This has the least number of memory accesses because the values are created, declared and initialized
 all in one step.

(3) This has the second least number of memory accesses because it creates and declares the variable in one
 step and then initializes it in the second.

(2) This has the most memory accesses because it creates, declares and initializes with zeros the variable
 in the first step and then initializes it again the second step.
