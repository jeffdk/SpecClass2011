Problem 2
=========
Technically, OneDimDataWriters use the "Factory" instead of the "Registry" (though thanks to Dan, the latter will soon be abolished, eliminating the confusion).

Use a .gitignore file so that Executables/Problem2Exec is not committed to the git repository.

Problem 3
=========
Header lacks #define guards!

Never use "using" statements in header files!

Undefined behavior if x.Size()=0!

Output from different times is not written to separate files.
