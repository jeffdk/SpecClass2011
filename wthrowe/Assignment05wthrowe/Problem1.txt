I am assuming A(0,0) is a typo for F(0,0).

Fewest: (1) DataMesh DetF = ...;

Second: (2) DataMesh DetF(F(0,0), 0.0); DetF = ...;
This assigns to every point in DetF twice: it first initializes them all to
0.0 and then sets them to the desired value.

Most:   (3) DataMesh DetF(F(0,0)); DetF = ...;
As in (2), this assigns to every point twice.  However, the initialization
values must additionally be read from F(0,0).
