Problem 1

- The code outputs {4 "12"}, which is the dimension and symmetry of tensor c.
- I can't seem to get valgrind working properly on SciNet or Kraken (in fact,
with SciNet, I get the error "Fatal Error: This program was not built to run 
on the processor in your system. The allowed processors are: Intel(R) 
processors with SSE4.2 and POPCNT instructions support."), so I can't really
say how much memory the program uses each time, but I'd imagine that having the
ampersands in the code would use less memory.  This is because when there is no
ampersand, then a and b are copied into memory, while when there are ampersands
a and b become the same variables as those in the function, so no copying need
take place.
