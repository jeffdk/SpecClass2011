I) in general:

*) no commenting of code.  Although it's pretty simple, so most
 comments would be extraneous, however see doxygen complaint below.

*) The name of the function doesn't seem to distinguish between
 computing the sum of volumes of spheres of unrelated radii, and the
 case which is much more common in SpEC where the radii indicate the
 boundaries of a set of nested spherical shells.  My initial
 impression was the later, but maybe I've been SpEC too long.  I'm
 sticking with the former for this assignment.

II) in .hpp file:

*) include guards are missing

*) #include MyVector not needed in header since it only appears as a
reference.  Will lead to unnecessary recompilation if MyVector
changes, but its interface does not.

*) If this was production SpEC code there should be some doxygen comments.

III) in .cpp file.

*) No error checking (ASSERT/REQUIRE) of the MyVector argument.
 Should check that radii has non-zero size, and that its entries are
 non-negative.

*) Pi is declared int, not double.

*) variable names could be more descriptive.  In particular r could be
 radius.

*) variables r and i are uninitialized in their declarations.

*) I prefer to put declaration of loop index variables in loop
 arguments.  I.e. it could have been for(int i=0; ...

*) definition of r in for loop shadows definition outside for loop.

*) in fact variable r probably isn't needed at all, or at least it
 could be made a reference to radii[i] inside the for loop.

*) It would appear that the line 
   result += (4/3)*Pi*r*r*r;
 was intended to be placed inside the body of the for loop, however
 due to a lack of braces, it's outside.
