Broke by:
1. Changed the Input of Trace from dQflattened to dQ.  It informs me
that Get<Tensor<DataMesh>>("dQ") failed because dQ is a
Tensor<Tensor<DataMesh> >.

2. Changed the Input of FirstDeriv from Q to dQflattened.  It informs
me that !mCurrentlyRecomputingMyself is violated because of a cyclic
dependency while trying to find dQflattened.
