- NonCopyable and MyVector don't appear to be used at all.
- "OOPS" is not a very useful error message.  (On the other hand,
  "mpImpl!=0 violated" is not too bad.)
- The default constructor creates objects in an invalid state.  This
  may be useful, but the constructor should probably be made explicit
  so that it can't be done accidentally.
- It would be better if Impl() could be made private somehow.  This
  would require changing the copy constructor and operator=.  At the
  very least the non const Impl() should not be there.
