short version:

The function's return type is a reference.


long version:

This function returns a reference to the double c. However, since c's
scope is limited to the funtion itself, c will be deallocated at the 
end of the function call. The reference to c will at that point become
meaningless, as the memory location will likely be reused by the code
for who knows what.
This leads to undefined behavior!
