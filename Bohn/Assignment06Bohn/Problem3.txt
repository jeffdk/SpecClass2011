1. I did get a divQ.dat file, which looked similar, but had a slightly
different result.  This is most likely due to compiler differences.

2. I broke the sequence by renaming the output to dQQ, instead of dQ.
This made dQQ a Tensor<Tensor<DataMesh> > in the DataBox, but I asked for
dQ through NormOfTensor.  Since dQ wasn't in the DataBox, it listed all of
the items in the box and told me what I was asking for.  It also listed exactly where the call came from.  

I asked for divQ to be outputted, but that needs dQflattened, which needs dQ, 
which isn't in the box.

The next way I broke the chain was asking for Trase instead of Trace.  Again,
this told me that I was asking for something which doesn't exist.  It then 
listed all known ComputeItems.
