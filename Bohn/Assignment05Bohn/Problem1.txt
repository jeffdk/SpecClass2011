(2) : This method is the slowest.  At the time the memory is allocated, the
      DataMesh has all values initialized to 0.0.  Immediately after, the memory
      is accessed again to replace the memory with the correct values.

(3) : This is the next best method. Think of this as number (2), but do not
      initialize all values to 0.0.  DetF temporarily has junk values, but this
      isn't a big problem because it's immediately filled in with the correct
      values.
      So the speedup here is that there is no time wasted initializing 
      pointlessly.

(1) : This method is the fastest.  At the time that the memory is allocated, the
      memory is initialized to the desired value.
      Compared to (3), we do not have to access the memory DetF again.  The 
      value of DetF is immediately initialized the first time it is accessed, 
      that is, when it is allocated.

SUMMARY:
(2) : created, initialized, accessed, stored correct values
(3) : created, accessed, stored correct values
(1) : created, initialized to correct values
