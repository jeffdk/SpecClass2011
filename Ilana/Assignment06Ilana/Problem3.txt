Problem 3 - Break sequence of ComputeItems

a) I first tried to break it by removing the first "u" in "EvaluateVectorFormula". This
gives me a big long error message saying first that "EvalateVectorFormula" is not a known
ClassID and then gives me a big long list of known ClassIDs.

b) I next tired to break it by changing the Output of FirstDeriv to ddQ. The error
message shows what the DataBoxes ApplyObservers and ApplyObservers/Sphere0 contain,
including ddQ, and then says that "Key 'dQ' not in DataBox 'ApplyObservers/Sphere0'".
This is because it breaks the sequence of inputs used by NormOfTensor, that is,
divQ -> dQflattened -> dQ.  If I changed the second reference to dQ in FlattenDeriv to
ddQ, it wouldn't break.

NOTE: When making my own ComputeItem, I mistakenly though that I had to include my assignment
directory in the SPEC_HOME/Support/ApplyObservers/Makefile, when it should actually be 
included in the SPEC_HOME/Support/ApplyObservers/Exectuables/Makefile.  This is an important
distinction to make.
