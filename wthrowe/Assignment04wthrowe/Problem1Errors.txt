Correctness Errors:
Pi is not an integer.
This is not Python.  for loops only act on the following statement, regardless
  of indentation.
4/3 == 1

Standards Violations:
Extra declaration of r.  (Compuounded the problems from the omitted braces
  above)
Scope of i is larger than necessary.
r can be declared const.
Unneccesary inclusion of MyVector.hpp in the header.
Missing include guards in the header.
Pi should not be written out explicitly.
