Problem 1
=========
Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it actually calls DataMesh's copy constructor.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).

Problem 2
=========
Try to keep lines from exceeding 80 characters, even for the Help() text.

Use a .gitignore file to ignore "Executables/Problem2Exec".

Problem 3
=========
"true" is not a double, so what is it doing as the default value in OptionParser::Get() on line 37?  Should this option even have a default value?

OutputReducedDatIlana.cpp compiles with warnings.  Be sure to enable warnings on your compiler (at least "-Wall -Wextra" for gcc), and make sure that your code compiles warning-free.

Write classes in .hpp/.cpp pairs, even if they are implementations of base classes that will never be directly instantiated.

Try to keep lines shorter than 80 characters.

I do not get the same results with your implementation as I get with the reference implementation (I need a much smaller MinAngle to get smooth output).
