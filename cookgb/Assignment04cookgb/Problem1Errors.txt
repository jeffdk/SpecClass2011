1) there are no comments in the code
2) Pi is declared as an int
3) result is declared before it is needed (but this goes away if the next two are fixed)
4) integer i is unnecessarily declared outside of the for loop
5) double r is unnecessarily declared outside of the for loop
6) double r is shadowed inside the for loop
7) r should be declared as const inside the loop
8) the for loop only include the declaration and initialization of double r.
   it needs to include the summing of the result
9) the factor (4/3) is performed as integer division
10) the multiplication by (4.0/3.0)*Pi only needs to be performed once
