The output of Example0 is 6 and the output of Example1 is 3. In Example0, f() takes a double as an argument and makes it equal to 6 inside the function. This doesn't affect variable passed into the function once it's outside the function. In Example1, however, f() takes a reference variable as an argument. So if the variable is changed inside this function, it's changed outside the function as well.
