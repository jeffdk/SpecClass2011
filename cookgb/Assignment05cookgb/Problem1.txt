The number of memory-accesses needed, fewest to most is:
(1), (3), (2).

In (3), the constructor creates memory for the data of the correct size, but does not assign any data to it.  This is less efficient than (1) because the copy assignment must check the Size() of the data twice, once before the Mesh info is copied and once after.  While the size will be correct (Assuming the variable A(0,0) was supposed to be F(0,0)) and the exesting memory will not need to be deleted and recreated, these two memory accesses and the conditional comparison are not performed in (1).

In (2), in addition to the problems in (3), this approach also requires all of the elements of DetF to be initialized to 0.0 which causes many unnecessary memory accesses.
