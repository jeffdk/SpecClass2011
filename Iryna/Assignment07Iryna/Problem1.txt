The code outputs {4, "12}

When running valgrind:
 - The code allocatead 17,288,798 bytes. 

When adding the ampersands: 
 - The code allocated 10,375,518 bytes. 

The ratio is: 1.666
Adding the two ampersands created two references, and therefore removed 2 TDMs.
It makes sense that the ration should be roughly 5/3.
