critique of RotationMatrix:
(as of revision 17695)


a) some unneeded header files:
   - myvector
   - noncopyable
  (i tried: the code compiles just fine with these headers removed)

b) the default constructor leaves behind a null pointer, which opens doors
   to unintended (=nasty) undefined behavior..

c) the member function Impl() doesn't do a perfect job of following the
   PImpl idea:
   - since the point is to obscure the abstract base class, it seems that
     it would be best to define this to be a private function. this way,
     external users wouldn't have access to the pointer to RotationMatrixImp

d) also, "oops" isn't exactly a helpful error message to run into.

   relatedly, this comment makes me twitch:
   "hey, let's try the right way of doing this"
   - the right way of doing what?
   - why is this right?
   - since this is so noteworthy, is the rest of the code "the wrong way" ??


improvements:

e) modernize by using the Factory system to register class rather than the
   cumbersome macros

f) modify the constructor to allow for a private Impl() function

g) fix the above issues by:
   - removing headers
   - possibly removing the default constructor completely, or making a better
     one
   - making a decision about Impl()
   - writing helpful error messages
