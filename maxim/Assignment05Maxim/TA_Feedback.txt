Problem 1
=========
Explanations?

Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it actually calls DataMesh's copy constructor.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).

Problem 2
=========
<cstdlib> does provide EXIT_SUCCESS, but it does NOT provide std::string; for that, include <string>.

Don't try to minimize includes by looking at what other headers include.  If you need MyVector.hpp, then include MyVector.hpp.

Comment out paramter name "time" to avoid compiler warning.

Since "Tests" does not exist, remove it from the Makefile (otherwise, compilation fails).

Use a .gitignore file to ignore "Executables/Problem2Exec".

Problem 3
=========
Undefined behavior if x.Size()=0!  Incorrect behavior if x.Size()=1.

Should check that 'x' and 'y' have the same length.

Avoid "using" statements at file scope.

Write classes in .hpp/.cpp pairs, even if they are implementations of base classes that will never be directly instantiated.

Avoid lines longer than 80 characters.

Output from different times is not written to separate files.
