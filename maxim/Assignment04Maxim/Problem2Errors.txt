In statement if(n=0) return 1; n gets assigned zero.
To avoid situations like that at compile time the prammeter n can be declared as const (along with a) like so
unsigned int RaiseToPower(const unsigned int a, const unsigned int n)

or/and

with the boolean expression in if reversed like so 
if(0 == n) return 1;
