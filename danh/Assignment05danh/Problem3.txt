There are definitely problems with this routine.  Because it checks adjacent
points, and not adjacent INCLUDED points, you can build up a total omitted
angle that is much greater than your point-by-point omitted angle.

As you can see in my 3 plots:

1) ReducedDat.0rad.pdf
2) ReducedDat.1e-4rad.pdf
3) ReducedDat.1.99e-4rad.pdf

#1 has no omitted points, #2 has omitted points but still appears identical
to #1, but #3, where MinAngle = 1.99e-4 radians, the plot no longer looks
identical to #1 (only the points near the inflection point, where the change
in angle is large, remain included).
