hw 5 - prob 3


i found that naively scanning the list of data using the given algorith 
results in flawed output due to the asymmetry in the scanning process:
one always checks the effects of one's actions on "future" points, but
not on "past" points. 

in particular, i noticed that the wings of my gaussian were getting cut off
on one side only, because as the algorithm advanced it wasn't checking to 
see that removing a point wouldn't create a sharp angle somewhere behind it.

i fixed this using the "anchorAngle" variable, and checking that the newly
obtained segment would not create a sharp angle against previously-checked
segments. this is still asymmetric but maintains sufficient smoothness for 
visual satisfaction :)

ideally one might write a code that scans forwards and then backwards, and
removes only points deemed "excessive" by both scans. or some other more
fancy method. in any case, not something i have time for in the context 
of this class :)


number of points in my output:
- no reduction in data: 2049
- 5 mrad angle-reduction: 383
=> 1666 points cut out by this process.

so the number of points is drastically reduced, and as far as i can tell, 
my plots are indistinguishable.




in addition to the issue mentioned above, i can think of two potential
problems:

- it becomes easier to see a kink in a long line than a short one. perhaps
  the algorithm should decrease the MinAngle as the proportional length of
  the segment within the figure increases.

- there are potential problems if one wishes to be robust to taking logarithms
  of the data within a plotting program: a straight line in a linlin graph 
  becomes a curve in a loglin graph. thus, data points which were useless in 
  one case become crucial in another.

  ideally, one would run the data-reduction on the same type of data as one
  intends to be plotting.
