I couldn't distinguish the plots.  I've saved these as MinAngle*.rdatBohn.  

MinAngle    Points Removed
    0             0
   0.01         1473
   0.1          1601
    1           1905

This method isn't so great.  If we have each angle differ by the minimum
  angle, then we will get a curving plot in the full version, but a straight
  line in the shortened version.  If write time isn't an issue, which it really
  shouldn't be, we can go over all of the points, as illustrated below.

X = removed
A = accepted

123456789
AXAXXXXXA

here is what should happen
- we should check angle 12 versus 23, then remove 2
- check 23 angle 34, find 3 passes
- check 34 angle 45, find 4 fails
- check 35 angle 56 AND check 45 angle 56, find 5 fails
- check 36 angle 67, check 46 angle 67, AND check 56 and 67.  etc.

You must check all points since the last accepted points, in order to have the
  most robust system.  If any of these fail, we need to accept the point.
  I've left a comment in the code where this should happen
