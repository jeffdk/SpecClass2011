the simple changes to ExploreDerivatives.input were made in
ExploreFDDerivatives.input.

the output from the Spectral code is in SpectralConvErr.dat
the outputs of the FD codes of different orders are in FD?ConvErr.dat

two plots from Xmgrblock are saved here:

1)
plotFD.pdf compares (on a log-log scale) the FD derivative errors
only. it is clear that increasing the number of point results in the
expected polynomial convergence, with the power increasing as with the
size of the stencil.

2)
plotAll.pdf compares (on a lin-log scale) the FD derivatives against
the Spectral derivatives. the massively better exponential convergence
of the Spectral derivative is obvious.
