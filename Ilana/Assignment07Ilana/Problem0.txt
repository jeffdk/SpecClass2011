Problem 0

The only difference between Examples 0 and 1 is that in the function f(), for
Example 0, it's f(double x) and in Example 1, it's f(double& x).  This extra &
means that for Example 1, x is passed as a reference (instead of as a value or
pointer), which means that now the x in f() and the x in main() are the same
variable.  So in Example 0, the output is 6 because the variable x is still the
same as it was assigned in main(), while in Example 1, the output is 3 because
the variable in main() becomes the variable in f(), and therfore changes value.
