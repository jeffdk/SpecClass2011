Problem 1
=========
Method (3) is actually less efficient than method (2).  Since DetF is initialized not with a bare Mesh but with a DataMesh, it actually calls DataMesh's copy constructor.  Reading and copying every element of A(0,0) is slower than just writing 0.0 as in (2).  (Here I am assuming that A is a TDm, presumably a typo that should have been F.  If A were a Tensor<Mesh>, your answer would be correct.)

Problem 2
=========
Excellent analysis in "Problem2.txt".

Code does not compile since "EXIT_SUCCESS" was not defined (need to "#include <cstdlib>")
