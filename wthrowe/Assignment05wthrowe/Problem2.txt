Format=bla;
It doesn't know how to output as bla, so it complains and lists the known
formats.  These are taken from the ClassID() methods of the various
OneDimDataWriters.

Format=help;
Prints out lots of documentation, describing the meanings of all the possible
values.  The output appears to be ClassID()+"\n"+Help() from each of the
OneDimDataWriters;

Format=grace(Legennd=Yes);
It complains that the Legennd option was not used (meaning providing it was
probably a misspelling or other mistake), and then displays documentation for
the grace OneDimDataWriter.  This documentation is
OneDimDataWriters::OutputGrace::Help() .
