1) Uncommenting line 33: Error occurs because I am trying to change an instance
   of the class that I declared as const.

2) Uncommenting line 38: The data member of the class has been declared as
   as constant. Here the code tries to change this const value and gives an
   error.

3) Uncommenting line 39: As above, I'm trying to change the value of the data 
   member of this class, resulting in an error since it has been declared
   constant.

4) Uncommenting line 41: Here I'm trying to set c1, which is of the MyClass2C
   type, equal to an int which has the wrong type; normally this works, since
   the constructor can take an int, but here with the "explicit" in the
   constructor definition it throws an error.

5) Uncommenting line 45: As in error 3, I'm trying to change the value of a
   data member in c3 which is declared constant.
